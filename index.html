        <article>
          <h3>Where did I start</h3>
          <p>I have always been intrested in computers and started learning in high school with python. I Started out making desktop 
            applications with python, and visualizing algorithms. Went from making functional apps that run on ones sytem to developing apps 
            that can be veiwed remotely and started my journey into web development.

            skills in these fields. Learning React, express, HTML, CSS and gaining professional certificates and certifications. Gaining
            in field experience and moving from home projects to real world practical implementaions.

          <h3>My experience with clients</h3>
          <p>
            my first developer work came when I was asked by a local church to make them an app. They need it to make it easier to schedule 
            events, add members, and give roles to members that attend.
